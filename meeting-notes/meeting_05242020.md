# Meeting 05/24/2022

Tasks:

- better workflow between colab and github

- implement the encoder by changing the layers of the pretrain model

- implement the LSTM model

- distribute tasks equally

- meet this weekend (remotely) to work on project

Questions to ask Joseph and Arth:

1. How to adjust pretrained model's convolution layer ?

2. Will trasformation be needed between Encoder and LSTM ?

3. Scheduling an inperson coding / work session with mentors?

4. timeline issues (possibities of pushing the presentation back?)
